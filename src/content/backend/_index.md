Backend reads data from `Mongo` database hosted on `mLab`.

### Development 

Project is hosted on [`Bitbucket`](https://bitbucket.org/frido/mvnrepo-backend/src/master/).
I used `InteliJ` to coding in `Kotlin` and to build with `Gradle`. Backend provides REST API what built on `Spring Boot`.
~~I monitor service via Actuator endpoints.~~

#### Libraries

* `spring boot`
* `swagger2`
* *json*: `Jackson`
* *mongo*: `MongoDB` vs ~~`Morphia`~~ vs ~~`Mongoose`~~ vs ~~`MongoJack`~~

*NOTE*: `JAX-RS` or `Jersey` are alternatives for `Spring-Web`. But why use something different when you already have Spring in your classpath.

### Tests

### Quality

### Documentation

You can try REST via [`Swagger`](https://mvnrepo-backend.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html).

### Deployment

`Bitbucket` provides [`Pipelines`](https://bitbucket.org/frido/mvnrepo-backend/addon/pipelines/home#!/) as a tool for CI.
`Buddy` pipeline is triggered on git push action and it deploys the application.

Application is deployed on [`Heroku`](https://mvnrepo-backend.herokuapp.com/)

*NOTE*: Disadvantagve of free Dyno on Heroku is that it get asleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. I dont believe backend has enought traffic to be still alive. So I configured `Buddy` pipeline to make request to Backend every 15 minutes. 1000 free dynos hours per month should be enought to keep Backend alive all month.

### Maitenance

It is hard to check logs directly on Heroku, so `LogEntries` integration was implemented.

### Books

I recomend to reading the book *Spring Boot in Action*.
