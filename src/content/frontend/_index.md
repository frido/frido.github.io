Frontend is `Angular5` application written in `Typescript` language.

### Development

Project is hosted on [`Visual Studio Team Services`](https://pfrido.visualstudio.com/mvnrepo/mvnrepo Team/) just to try somethink new.
My favourite editor for `Typescript` is ~~`Atom`~~ `Visual Studio Code`.
`Boostrap4` was used for page teplates generated by `Sass`.

#### Dependencies

* `angular/cli`
* `Boostrap4` vs ~~`Semantic UI`~~ vs many many more
