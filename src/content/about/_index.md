This is a showcase of a web application for a startup company. Here you can find inspiration and comparison of the newest technologies, libraries and tools.
The Showcase demonstrates also the entire development process with code-quality checks, continuous integration and devops configuration.
The showcase demonstrates that startup can exists for free, because every tool used in here has a free pricing policy.

### Architecture

**mvnRepo** searches for the latest versions of your Java dependencies, checks the activity and popularity of the libraries and much more.

The **mvnRepo** application allows you to easily search for information about Java libraries. 
It collects the pom files from the maven central repository and extracts relevant data.
For libraries hosted in the GitHub repo, it gathers also information from GitHub.

**mvnRepo** comprises three applications. Each application was developed in different technologies.

* **Indexer**: coded in `Java8` in `Visual Studio Code`
* **Backend**: coded in `Kotlin` in `InteliJ`
* **Frontend**: coded in `Angular5` in `Visual Studio Code`

### Environment

This document was written in `Typora`.

Tasks are managed by ~~`Trello`~~ `Visual Studio Team Service`.
Technologies are listed in `Stackshare` [![StackShare](https://img.shields.io/badge/tech-stack-0690fa.svg?style=flat)](https://stackshare.io/frido/mvnrepo).

I work on my Windows 10 machine. 
I use `Git` with ~~`SourceTree`~~ `GitKraken` as a graphical user interface.
Just for fun I monitor my development time on `Wakatime`.
I like `hyper.js`.
